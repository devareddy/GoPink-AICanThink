message: Effect of tamoxifen and radiotherapy in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ
        text: The UK/ANZ DCIS trial demonstrated that radiotherapy reduced new breast events of ipsilateral invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ compared to no radiotherapy, and beneficial effects of both tamoxifen and radiotherapy were confirmed in reducing local and contralateral new breast events for women with DCIS treated by complete local excision. Additionally, it was found that compared to tamoxifen, anastrozole treatment provided a significant improvement in breast cancer-free interval, mainly in women younger than 60 years of age. However, there is still controversy as to whether complete local excision alone is sufficient and no significant effects were noted with tamoxifen.
